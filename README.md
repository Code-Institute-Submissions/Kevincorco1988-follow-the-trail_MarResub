# FOLLOW THE TRAIL - My first milestone project of the 5 projects for the Software Development diploma with the Code Institute.

### Introduction: Kevin Corcoran

I looked into the code institute a few years back but couldn't afford it at that time. When I saw an advert online for it a few months ago, I thought it was fate and decided to give the 5 day coding challenge a try. 

This is my first prject on the course and I took some inspiration for the website from the love running webiste in the module. I wanted to make a websiste for a group for people in the Cork, Ireland area who are trail and hill walking lovers. I'm a nature lover myself and I found exploring relaxing and enjoyable. The group of course is fictional but if I was to create a group like this I would want it to have some of the features on the website that I have created.

## The Strategy Plane

### Website Objectives

**Who's our target demographic:**   

The idea was to create a fictional trail and hill walking group for people in Cork. The target was anyone who loves nature looking to escape the normal weekly routine with something different and enjoyable. The hope was to make it a freindly and approachable environment. 

**What's our value:**

The group focused just as much on the mental/physical health benefits of being in the outdoors than just being in outdoors as an activity. I set up the website so that new/existing users can see what destinations are coming up for our trips. Social media accounts were added in case there are specific questions that a potential member may have. The destinations/meet-up point section show the destinations, times and meet-up points to make it easier for the site visitor to know enough about the process to join the group right away.

## The Scope Plane

### Requirements and Functional Specifications

**Owner Goals**
   - Make the webiste easy to navigate and use across all devices and screen sizes
   - To have the majority of the information on the landing page so that the user doesn't miss anything
   - Use images, icons and health benefits to create a beautiful, healthy and social experience
   - Have social media links on the footer of each page for easy access to contact us
   - Have a responsive sign up form with the ability to reset and submit

**First-time/Repeat User Goals**
   - To find out the information (destinations times etc) needed easily and quickly
   - Have the ability to join us now through the form or contact us via social media for further information
   - To see what the experience looks like through images

## The Structure Plane

### **Interaction Design**
   - **Consistent:** I tried to be consistent with the colors used, the layout of headings (navigation bar appears horizontally) and footers
   - **Predictable:** The layout consistency makes it predcictable how the next page should look
   - **Learnable:** Its predictability and simple navigation makes it easy to learn
   - **Visible:** Everything is clearly visible due to the mixture of colors and layout
   - **Feedback:** The form has a congratulations message to show that the information has been submitted. The reset button clears the information back to the placeholder text showing the user that the information has been reset.

### **Information Archictecture**
The layout of the website was structured to proviude a user-friendly experience by allowing the user to move through the website freely and not get lost along the way. The header with has the navigation bar and the footer has the social media links to ensure this also.

## The Skeleton Plane
I wanted the webiste to be structured in the most user-friendly way by add the right content in the right places. My hope would be that each page would be enough to have the user move to the next one.

The navigation was to be placed at the top of the page and the contact us area on the footer of each page so that the user would find information on either end as they finish scrolling. Tha landing page had some nice visuals such as icons and images to give a clear understanding of what the site was and what it stood for.

**Wireframes link included here:** ![Wireframes](https://kumquat-bedbug-j2n74art.ws-eu16.gitpod.io/)
They are added as images in the images file

## The Surface Plane

The surface and finshed look of the website is consistent across key areas. The color, color-contrast, layout, fonts and patterns are all examples of the consistency shown on the surface to the user providing a pleasing experience to the user. 

# Issues and Troubleshooting

On the "trails" page there were some issues with the how long the loading time of that page was. I tried to improve this by compressing the size of the images but this did not have effect in terms of loading speed that I wanted and so the issue remains unresolved. 

Also, the images on  the trails page are not lined up perfectly towards the bottom on the devices. This is another unresolved issue.
